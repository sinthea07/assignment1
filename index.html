                            really busy in a nice way. As a key member of the Mission development team, I've spent the
                            last few years honing my MERN Stack skills by designing unique websites.

                            Tomorrow's world will be very different and, in many respects, much better. We will have
                            progressed to a considerably higher level of technological development. We will have made

                            Setting a goal is essential for staying on track. Also, let's be honest, learning to code is
                            a lot more fun when you know what you want to do. First and foremost, let's be honest about
                            what we desire.
